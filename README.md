# recbad-site-redesign

Sucessive redesign prototypes of the Recreational Badminton Club website made in 2014
(most images have been replaced with placeholders)

# Prototype 1

    Initial design choices

    * An ugly colour scheme
    * Simple header, content, footer structure
    * The sticky footer code used came from http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ (the site is no longer active)
    * Designed mainly in ems so that CTRL + +; didn't break the layout of the page or the sticky footer

# Prototype 2

    Major changes
    
    * The layout was changed to a header, content & sidebar layout
    * Menu layout and column layout were adapted from code on http://matthewjamestaylor.com/
    * The declaration was changed from XHTML strict code to the newer html5 declaration
    * Partial layout adjustment for smaller screens using media queries</li>

# Prototype 3

    Major changes
    
    * Images and embeds are more responsive to changes in screen size 
    * Addition of a crude gallery
    * An improved mobile-size layout and the start of a tablet-size layout

## Planned improvements which would need javascript knowledge:
    
    * A script to add a button for expanding and collapsing the menu for the mobile-size layout
    * A script so that the images in the gallery can be scrolled through at full-size instead of needing to open each image individually
