# Website redesign prototypes

Sucessive redesign prototypes made in 2013 to potentially become the new website for Southampton University Recreational Badminton Club
(most images have been replaced with placeholders)

# [Prototype 1](p1)

Initial design choices

* An ugly colour scheme
* Simple header, content, footer structure
* The sticky footer code used was written by Ryan Fait http://mail.ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/
    
# [Prototype 2](p2)

Major changes
    
* The layout was changed to a header, content & sidebar layout
* Menu layout and column layout were adapted from code on [https://matthewjamestaylor.com/](https://matthewjamestaylor.com/)
* The declaration was changed from XHTML strict code to the newer html5 declaration
* Partial layout adjustment for smaller screens using media queries

# [Prototype 3](p3)

Major changes
    
* Images and embeds were made more responsive to changes in screen size 
* Addition of a crude gallery
* An improved mobile-size layout and the start of a tablet-size layout


## Planned improvements after learning javascript:
    
* A script so that a menu button would expand and collapse the menu for the mobile-size layout
* A script so that the images in the gallery page could be scrolled through at full-size instead of needing to open each image individually
