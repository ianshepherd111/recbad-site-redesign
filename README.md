# Website redesign prototypes

Sucessive redesign prototypes made in 2014 to potentially become the new website for Southampton University Recreational Badminton Club
(most images have been replaced with placeholders)

# [Prototype 1](https://github.com/ianshepherd111/recbad-site-redesign/p1/test.html)

Initial design choices

* An ugly colour scheme
* Simple header, content, footer structure
* The sticky footer code used came from http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ (the site is no longer active)
    
# [Prototype 2](https://github.com/ianshepherd111/recbad-site-redesign/p2/test.html)

Major changes
    
* The layout was changed to a header, content & sidebar layout
* Menu layout and column layout were adapted from code on [https://matthewjamestaylor.com/](https://matthewjamestaylor.com/)
* The declaration was changed from XHTML strict code to the newer html5 declaration
* Partial layout adjustment for smaller screens using media queries

# [Prototype 3](https://github.com/ianshepherd111/recbad-site-redesign/p3/test.html)

Major changes
    
* Images and embeds were made more responsive to changes in screen size 
* Addition of a crude gallery
* An improved mobile-size layout and the start of a tablet-size layout

## Planned improvements which would need javascript knowledge:
    
* A script to add a button for expanding and collapsing the menu for the mobile-size layout
* A script so that the images in the gallery can be scrolled through at full-size instead of needing to open each image individually
